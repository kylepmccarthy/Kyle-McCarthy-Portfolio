I collaborated with Tristan Grupp in creating a machine learning model to predict heroin overdose risk in Cincinnati, Ohio. Our algorithm helps the Cincinnati City Government to determine where social services should be allocated, along with EMS services to prevent heroin overdose deaths. The data is then developed into a user friendly web application to best determine where EMS and rehabilition services should be placed.

Often times the distance from a trauma center to a hospital determines if a car crash victim survives. In the state of Vermont, there are only two trauma centers meaning that much of the state is at a higher risk for car crash deaths. This ArcPy tool determines where a new hospital is best located, specifically looking at where car crash risk is the highest along with underserved regions within the state.

According to the California Geologic Survey, San Diego is vulnerable for a potential 6.9 earthquake. Below is the github repo for a future preparedness earthquake application. The user selects a zip code for a future potential earthquake epicenter. Based on the epicenter the app predicts the damage cost in each zip code. The user than has the option to select a zip code to view all public buildings, their current condition, and overall cost. Based on these values, we come up with a metric to determine building damage while highlighting which buildings should be repaired to withstand an earthquake.

The motivation of this study is to create a model regarding weather an individual will take the credit for a home repair tax credit in Emil City. Typically only 11% of the homeowners take the credit. Recently, the department created a new marketing campaign where they now project that 25% of the homeowners take the credit. A sample of records were given, which were then feature engineered in an attempt to create a more accurate model. The costs of marketing is 2850 dollars per person. However, when someone takes the credit the department makes 5000 dollars. The community also receives a benefit from the credit. Surrounding homes gain a 56000 dollar aggregate premium, while houses that take the credit sell with a 10000 dollar premium. This particular study creates a model to determine weather a specific individual will take the credit or not. A cost analysis of the model will also be performed, analyzing the model’s performance.

Bike share is a growing form of green transportation across the United States and the world. For Indego bikeshare in Philadelphia to maximize bike share usage across the city, they must account for balancing. To predict bike share usage, this particular algorithm accounts for spatial, and temporal scales to determine when and where bikes should be allocated to maximize bike share usage in Philadelphia.

Philadelphia is a diverse city earning the title of the "city of neighborhoods." Although neighborhood boundaries are often subjective, there are over fifty neighborhoods within the city limits. Each neighborhood has its distinct characteristics, consisting of significant differences in demographics, infrastructure, and land use. The spatial variability across the city creates a challenge for spatial modeling. Our goal is to evaluate median house values and their relationship to numerous census variables for this project utilizing OLS regression.

This study utilizes spatial lag, spatial error, and geographically weighted regression to  account for spatial autocorrelation. The last study found that housing vacancy, college  attainment, poverty status and singly family homes were strong predictors of housing units  median value. We found this by regressing the dependent variable median house value on the  predictors housing vacancy, single family homes, college attainment, and poverty. Although the  findings were statistically significant, the method did not account for spatial autocorrelation. This  report intends to account for spatial lag, spatial error, and geographically weighted regression to  determine if these methods are more suited for geographic analysis than ordinary least squares  regression.

### Writing Samples 

This particular paper is an analysis of Swanton, Vermont's zoning ordinance. There is a significant focus on how Swanton can best preserve it's agriculture industry through zoning, provide recreational opportunity to Swanton residence while ensuring that Swanton's downtown village acts as it's commerical economic center.

A professional paper describing the behavior of chromium within the mineral tourmaline. An analysis of nine recently published, high-precision structures of chromium-bearing tourmaline, in combination with the Adirondack tourmaline, suggests that structural changes to the Y-site at low concentrations of Cr3+ induce changes in the Z-site that make it more amenable to incorporation of the Cr3+ substituents by increasing <Z–O>. The bond lengths change to lower the bond-valence sum of Cr3+ in the Z-site of the chromium-dravite, making that site more amenable to the substituent. Calculations suggest that the Z-site begins to accept substituent Cr3+ when the bond valence sum of that ion in Z reduces to a value of ~3.36 valence units

Utilizing model builder in ArcGIS, this web application creates a model for interpolating geochronologic ages within the Chester Dome. For successful completion of this assignment, data had to be compiled into a single data set, topology errors were corrected, and the we application was deployed utilizing ArcGIS Online.

These series of data visualizations represent where Burlington services are located. Utilizing spatial distribution of the services, we determined which regions in Burlington are currently undeserved by the Burlington Bus System. Green Mountain Transit utilized the findings to create better bus routes within the city.
